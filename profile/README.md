# 🧠📐 UPRYGEN LABS  
### AI-Powered Posture & Mood Intelligence for Wearables

Welcome to **Uprygen Labs**, an R&D-focused organization building the next generation of **on-device health AI** for smartwatches and smartphones.

Our mission is to create a **privacy-first, scientifically grounded** posture and emotion-insight system powered by:

- Real-time motion sensors  
- HR & HRV biometrics  
- Lightweight ML models  
- On-device inference (no cloud needed)  
- Beautiful, intuitive UX  

This organization contains all core components of the Uprygen ecosystem.

## 🚀 Our Vision  
To build the world’s smartest posture + emotional wellness companion using **AI, biomechanics, psychology, and wearable computing**.

We combine:
- Sensor fusion  
- Posture detection  
- HRV-based mood classification  
- Personalized coaching  
- Behavioral analytics  

All running **locally**, keeping your data 100% private.
